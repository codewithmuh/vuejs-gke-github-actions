# Deploy Vuejs Application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) - Blue Green Deployment.
I will use GitHub Actions to deploy our VueJS project on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

![Terraform course (10)](https://github.com/codewithmuh/crbn_frontend/assets/51082957/2cd7c40e-2c19-485b-b7eb-3ade6f211cc6)


## Overview:

We will deploy the Vuejs Application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). We will use Github actions for the ci/cd pipeline. We will use Google Compute Engine as the self-hosted runner for our GitHub Actions. We will integrate Sonarcube for code analysis and Triv Image scan to scan our docker images. Also, we will integrate Slack to get Build/deployment notifications.
